# Zoo-Folder-Structure-Creation-Mini-Project
In this project, I created a well-organized folder structure representing a zoo using basic Linux commands on Ubuntu Desktop. The goal was to demonstrate my skills in using the command-line interface to create a hierarchical directory structure and showcase my ability to work with Linux-based systems.
